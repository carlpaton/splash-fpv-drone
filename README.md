# Splash FPV Drone

These files orginally came from [jacks3dprinting](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4741274/files), check out the facebook group [jacks 3d printing](https://www.facebook.com/groups/315905552404441)

## 2020_BOTTOM

The file comes as .dxf which I think is for laser cutting from carbon fiber, this is what the kit comes with from my [local hobby shop](https://www.quadjunkie.co.nz/product/splash-cinewhoops-from-jacks-3d/). Although I have my doubts about rigidity and actually flying I figured I'd 3D print the whole drone from PETG and see what happens. This was how I converted the files

1. Open 2020_BOTTOM.dxf in [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/), I use their Education License but the product is too complicated for me
1. Extrude the main shape by 5mm and export as 2020_BOTTOM.step
1. Open 2020_BOTTOM.step in [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/en/), this product is much easier for my simple brain
1. My 3D printer is a K1C with a max print volumn of 220x220x250, so I [chopped off each side by 3.05mm to make it fit](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/10d304fa08ec89b5c3c82cf4/w/95be4216cc5ec3a5ac78ad2f/e/0e5da90423fec7daeeb563ab), I dont think this was smart in terms of design but Ive done dumber things in my time on earth
1. Export as splash bottom.stl and print, the only setting I changed was the wall loops/count = 7
